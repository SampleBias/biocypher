# bi0cyph3r - DNA Cryptography System

A sophisticated, secure Flask web application that allows users to encode and decode messages using DNA cryptography with enterprise-grade security features and nanopore sequencing optimization.

## 📋 Protocol Specification

**For implementers and developers**: See [PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md](PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md) for the complete formal protocol specification, including:
- Exact encoding/decoding algorithms
- Sequence format definitions
- Error handling specifications
- Test vectors and conformance requirements

This specification enables interoperability - any compliant implementation can encode/decode BioCypher sequences.

## Features

- 🛡️ **Security Hardened**: CSRF protection, rate limiting, input validation
- 🧬 **Advanced DNA Crypto**: Three-mode encoding with basic, nanopore, and secure options
- 🔬 **Nanopore Optimized**: Error correction, homopolymer avoidance, GC balancing
- 🛡️ **Safety Screener**: Comprehensive biosafety analysis to prevent pathogen synthesis
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive, modern interface with mode selection
- 📊 **Analytics**: Comprehensive DNA sequence statistics and nanopore risk assessment
- ⚡ **Performance**: Optimized code structure and error handling
- 🧪 **Tested**: Comprehensive unit test coverage (17 test cases)
- 📝 **Logging**: Detailed application logging for monitoring

## How It Works

bi0cyph3r offers three encoding modes:

### Basic Mode
Uses the four nucleotide bases (A, T, C, G) to represent binary data:
- A = 00, T = 01, C = 10, G = 11
- Converts text to ASCII, then to binary, and maps binary pairs to DNA bases
- Fast and suitable for educational purposes and small messages

### Nanopore Optimized Mode  
Advanced encoding designed for nanopore sequencing with:
- **Triplet Encoding**: Uses 8 homopolymer-free triplets (ATC, ATG, ACT, ACG, TAG, TAC, TCG, TCA)
- **Error Correction**: Triple redundancy encoding with majority voting
- **Parity Checking**: Even parity bits for error detection
- **Homopolymer Avoidance**: Prevents problematic consecutive identical bases
- **GC Content Balancing**: Maintains 40-60% GC content optimal for nanopore
- **Nanopore Markers**: Special start/stop sequences for reliable sequencing
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive nanopore compatibility scoring

### 🔒 Secure Mode (NEW)
Enterprise-grade cryptographic security combined with DNA encoding:
- **AES-256-CBC Encryption**: Military-grade encryption before DNA encoding
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: 100,000 iterations with SHA-256 for password-based encryption
- **Password Protection**: Strong password validation and secure password generation
- **Cryptographic Security**: True security unlike obfuscation-only approaches
- **Nanopore Compatible**: Uses basic DNA encoding with nanopore markers for sequencing compatibility
- **Production Ready**: Suitable for real-world secure data storage applications

## 🛡️ Safety Screener (NEW)

The integrated DNA Safety Screener provides comprehensive biosafety analysis to prevent inadvertent synthesis of potentially harmful sequences:

### Safety Analysis Features
- **🦠 Pathogen Detection**: Screens for viral polymerase, toxin genes, antibiotic resistance, and virulence factors
- **🧬 Natural Occurrence Check**: Detects sequences from housekeeping genes, E. coli, and human genomes
- **📊 Sequence Analysis**: Evaluates GC content, ORFs, homopolymer runs, and repetitive elements
- **⚠️ Risk Assessment**: Provides LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk classification with detailed explanations
- **💡 Recommendations**: Clear guidance on synthesis safety with specific warnings

### Safety Status Indicators
- **✅ SAFE (Green)**: No risks detected - approved for synthesis
- **⚠️ CAUTION (Orange)**: Some concerns found - review carefully before synthesis
- **❌ UNSAFE (Red)**: Do not synthesize - potential pathogen or harmful sequence detected

### How Safety Screening Works
1. **Encode your message** using any of the three DNA cryptography modes
2. **Click the "🛡️ Safety Screen" button** next to the Copy button
3. **Review the comprehensive report** showing:
   - Overall safety status with color-coded indicator
   - Detailed pathogen analysis with signature matches
   - Natural genome occurrence check
   - Sequence characteristics and warnings
   - Specific recommendations for safe synthesis

The safety screener uses pattern matching against known pathogen signatures and natural sequences to identify potentially problematic DNA sequences before synthesis.
