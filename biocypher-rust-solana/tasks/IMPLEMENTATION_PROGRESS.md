## Current Progress

**Completed**: Basic DNA crypto (mostly working), API structure, Safety screener

**In Progress**: Fixing Basic DNA crypto test failures

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix test failures in Basic DNA crypto
2. Implement Nanopore DNA crypto
3. Implement Secure DNA crypto
4. Update API to support all modes

---

## Issues Found

1. **Basic DNA Crypto Tests Failing** (5 tests):
   - test_encode_simple: Expecting "TAAA" but getting "TAAT"
   - test_decode_simple: Related to encode
   - test_invalid_bases_skipped: Not skipping invalid bases correctly
   - test_newline_characters: Not preserving newlines
   - test_clean_sequence: Not handling 'N' correctly

2. **Build Warnings**:
   - Unused imports in dna/mod.rs (cleanup needed)
