# BioCypher Rust + Solana Migration - Activity Log

## 2025-01-20

### 14:30 - Initial Project Review and Planning
**Actions Taken**:
- Analyzed existing BioCypher Python project structure
- Reviewed core components:
  - `app.py` - Flask application with 3 encoding modes
  - `dna_crypto.py` - Basic DNA encoding/decoding
  - `nanopore_dna_crypto.py` - Nanopore-optimized encoding with error correction
  - `secure_nanopore_dna_crypto.py` - AES-256 encryption + DNA encoding
  - `safety_screener.py` - Pathogen detection and risk assessment
  - `PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` - Complete protocol specification

**Key Findings**:
- 42 total test cases across 3 modules
- Three encoding modes: Basic, Nanopore, Secure
- Comprehensive safety screening with pathogen database
- Well-documented protocol specification for interoperability
- Current implementation: Python/Flask with cryptography library

### 14:45 - Architecture Decision
**Decision**: Hybrid Architecture - Rust backend (off-chain) + Solana blockchain (on-chain)

**Rationale**:
- Performance: Rust handles fast crypto operations
- Flexibility: Users choose on-chain or off-chain per operation
- Cost Efficiency: Only pay Solana when verification needed
- User Experience: Quick response times for most operations
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling of Rust + Solana throughput
- Fallback: Can operate off-chain if Solana congested

**Confidence Level**: HIGH
